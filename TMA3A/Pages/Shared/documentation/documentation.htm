            <p class="p">
                In this part of the assignment, the main objective was to develop an online computer webstore using ASP.NET in C# in which customers can select a computer from a list and customize it by replacing some components in its standard configuration. Customers can then place an order with the online store. This is what is stated in the assignment description.
            </p>
            <br \>
            <p class="p">The requirements were quite specific for this task:</p>
            <ul class="p" style="margin-left:5%">
                <li>The application running in a web browser should be like a real online store.</li>
                <li>The application has a clean and easy-to-use interface, with menus and navigation buttons</li>
                <li>It has a name and logo shown across all the pages</li>
                <li>It begins with a welcome message to greet customers</li>
                <li>It has other pages such as policies, a feedback form, etc</li>
                <li>There should be at least 5 components available</li>
                <li>A customer can select a computer with default configuration and customize it.</li>
                <li>Whenever a change has been made by the customer, the price total updates dynamically </li>
                <li>After the customer has hit the Buy button, a summary is displayed.</li>
                <li>All links, menus, and buttons within the online store should be active. .</li>

            <br \>
            <p class="p">
                As asked in the assignment description, I visited some online stores such as Bestbuy.ca and Apple.ca and analysed their designs/functionality. Here’s what I found:
            </p>
            <ul class="p" style="margin-left:5%">
                <li>At the very top, all these websites had a menu bar with navigation links to the main pages of the website.</li>
                <li>The navbar included a button to manage your account and a button to check your cart on the far right, and a search bar in the center</li>
                <li>Some websites had a welcome message, a slideshow with their latest products, along with some nice graphics</li>
                <li>When we go onto their catalog, we observe a picture of the product displayed along with the price, and a button to add the item to the cart.</li>
                <li>On some websites, there was an additional button to view details of the product before adding it to cart.</li>
                <li>When items are added to cart, we observe that following: a picture of the product, the option to remove the item, its quantity, and its price.</li>
                <li>At the very bottom we observe the grand total</li>
                <li>When the buy button is clicked, we see a summary of our items and some input boxes to enter in our personal information.</li>
                <li>Once an order is submitted, a confirmation email is recieved</li>
                <li>Some websites had a feedback form</li>

            </ul>
            <br \>
            <p class="p">These websites were carefully studied and analyzed to create my web application. I created rough storyboards of the web app’s functionality and implemented it using Agile methodology and daily sprints. Pretty much all of the observations listed above are implemented into my website. Below I will provide you with my rough storyboards I made before I started coding the web app and the final results as well! </p>

                When the user clicks “View Details”, they are presented with the following page. The computer is customizable and the price updates dynamically in real time. <strong>I would like to make it clear that the contents of this page are NOT hard-coded. I made JSON files for the components that are parsed and processed on the server-side and displayed to the user. </strong> All the options that the user sees from the dropdown boxes are generated from the JSON files.

                When the user is done shopping, they can view their cart. The user can remove items if they change their mind. The price is displayed next to the item and the grand total is displayed at the very bottom of the webpage. Items in the cart are managed using Http Sessions

                I went the extra mile to send a summary of the order to the user’s email once they place the order. This feature is obviously not complete, but the backend is implemented. I haven’t formatted the contents of the email, but you can see that a summary of all the items in the cart along with the price and image is emailed to the user. I look forward to implementing the front-end of this feature in the near future.

                This is the basic functionality of the web app. Other than this, there are some extra pages on the website for a more professional look which provide some extra information to the customers. For example, I have a page about Delivery information:

            <p class="p">As demonstrated above, all of the requirements were successfully implemented for this part, and a few extra features were implemented as well.</p>
            <br \>
            <p class="p">I personally feel that everything was implemented properly, and all functions work as expected for this part of the assignment. The application follows a minimalist design so it looks good and is easy to use. The whole web application is deployed on a live web server, and accessible for you to evaluate. Once again, unfortunately, I also had to purchase access to Azure’s services because my free credits expired. I’ve thoroughly tested this application, so PLEASE contact me if you have any issues with anything!</p>

            <p class="p">Once a user logs in with valid credentials, they are presented with the following page and they stay logged in until the log-out button is pressed.

            <p class="p">If a user wants to register, they can do it from the following page. The application checks to make sure that an account with that username doesn’t already exist and displays an error as shown below. Once registered, the user can log back in.</p>
